# ChanduBaking
Baking app, with recipes and cooking videos

This consisted of a few recipe details. The details included the steps for making the dish, with videos in some cases.
In a normal mobbile, the videos are inside within the steps, and selecting the individual step, would show either an image/video or would mention that nothing is available.

If the video is clicked and if the device is rotated to be in the landscape mode, the complete screen would be used.

The images of the app from a tablet are as below:
